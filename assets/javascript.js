//CREATE CODE HERE THAT STARTS TO GENERATE A DIV OF BUTTONS LIKE THE DRAWINGS

//WITH LUMBER SELECTED IN THE DROPDOWN, POPULATE BUTTONS WITH lumberBtns.boards.dimensions array

//A SHORT DIV ABOVE THE BUTTONS WILL SHOW FOR EXAMPLE " 2 x _"

//SAME DIMENSION BUTTONS REMAIN IN THE DIV

//AFTER A PRESS OF ANOTHER OF THESE BUTTONS: DIV SHOWS " 2 x 4 x _"

//SAME DIMENSION BUTTONS REMAIN IN THE DIV

//WHEN THIRD BUTTON IS PRESSED: DIV SHOW " 2 x 4 x 8 _"

//NOW WE CLEAR THE BUTTON DIV WITH NEW BUTTONS FROM LumberBtns.boards.type

//WHEN BUTTON IS SELECTED: DIV SHOW " 2 x 4 x 8 FIR"

//NOW WE CLEAR THE BUTTON DIV AND SHOW A QTY FIELD WITH A +/- BUTTONS NEXT TO IT. DEFAULT QTY TO 1 AND ALLOW FOR THE BUTTONS
//TO RAISE OR LOWER THE QTY, OR LARGE QUANTITIES CAN BE MANUALLY ENTERED

//AT THIS TIME, A BUTTON THAT SAYS 'ADD' WILL APPEAR NEAR THE BOTTOM ABOVE THE LIST BUTTON WHICH COULD ALWAYS REMAIN THERE

//PRESSING 'ADD' WILL PUSH THIS WHOLE STRING " 2 x 4 x 8 FIR = QTY 10" (or "2 x 4 x 8 FIR = 10) KEY VALUE TO FIREBASE UNDER
//THE NAME OF THE PERSON PLACING THE LIST ORDER i.e. name: str1, str2, str3 AND SO ON.

//HOPE THIS HELPS GETTING US STARTED AT GENERATING A WORKING DISPLAY!!!
